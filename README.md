# Studylab_10

### Interactive Educational Platform for Class 10

This project is a modern, interactive web application built with React and Vite, designed to make science education engaging and accessible for Class 10 students. The platform features four core modulesâ€”Atomic Structure, Waves, Optics, and Area of Trianglesâ€”each with dynamic simulations, study materials, and assessments.

### **Features**

* **Interactive Simulations:** Explore scientific concepts in a hands-on way with real-time 3D animations for Atomic Structure and interactive tools for Waves, Optics, and Triangles.
* **Dynamic Assessments:** Each module includes a quiz to test knowledge. Performance metrics, including average score and tests completed, are tracked to help students monitor their progress.
* **Comprehensive Content:** Study materials cover key theories, formulas, and real-world applications relevant to the Class 10 curriculum.
* **User-Friendly Interface:** Built with Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui, the platform features a clean, intuitive design that prioritizes user experience and educational focus.
